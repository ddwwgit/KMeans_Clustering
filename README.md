# K-Means Clustering with Python

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that breaks down the implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm, a fundamental machine learning algorithm used for unsupervised learning and pattern discovery. The notebook guides through the process from theoretical understanding to practical application, using a dataset that demonstrates the clustering of data points.

## Contents
- `KMeans.ipynb`: The primary Jupyter notebook with step-by-step instructions and code cells for executing the K-Means clustering algorithm.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset used in the analysis.
- `images/`: Directory containing any images or figures generated by the notebook.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following software installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy (for numerical computations)
- (Include other libraries used in the notebook, if any)

## Usage
To run the notebook:
1. Navigate to the `KMeans.ipynb` notebook within the Jupyter interface in your web browser.
2. Execute the code cells in sequence to see how K-Means clustering is implemented and observe the clustering results.
